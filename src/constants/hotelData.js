            "review_text": "Nice Clean Hotel... spacious rooms... aesthetics of hotel rooms and corridors is beautiful.. location is very near to all the tourist attractions... you find autos as well as Ola cabs come to this location very easily.\n\nIf travelling by own vehicle outside you can park they have a road side space but no parking available inside. I am mentioning this point because many well known properties in old city Udaipur are not accessible by own vehicle. You have to hire auto or two wheeler.But here cars come.\nLake view is not that great as it is a lake side property but this side of lake is not that clean as it is extended part of Pichola which narrows down to this point.\nTheir hospitality and food is good.\nSangria is their rooftop bar you can spend nice evening with drinks and music just order snacks main course is not good at Sangria. Their other restaurant have decent food.",

The images are absolutely deceptive.\n\nEven the alternative room given to us was in an equally bad condition.\n\nAnd there is a club within the property that blasts music all the way till 11PM. So if you've come to enjoy the quiet night than this is definitely not the place.\n\nDO NOT STAY AT THIS PROPERTY!\n\nThe hotel absolutely made a lovely trip across Rajasthan a sour one.\n\nA little higher and you get the trident at the similar price point instead!",

If travelling by own vehicle outside you can park they have a road side space but no parking available inside. I am mentioning this point because many well known properties in old city Udaipur are not accessible by own vehicle. You have to hire auto or two wheeler.But here cars come. Lake view is not that great as it is a lake side property but this side of lake is not that clean as it is extended part of Pichola which narrows down to this point. Their hospitality and food is good. Sangria is their rooftop bar you can spend nice evening with drinks and music just order snacks main course is not good at Sangria. Their other restaurant have decent food. Rooms: Well decorated spacious rooms Nearby activities: Centrally located to all tourist spots Safety: Safe as it is not secluded spots well connected Walkability: Have broad road making it accessible to cars as well as auto or traveller bus Food and drinks: Food is good they have a cafe 24hours open... you can walk in just for coffee anytime",

However, the food quality could be improved in terms of taste and hygiene, and the food service team could benefit from additional training on service and managing restaurant odors. The outdoor area near the restaurant could be safer, as there's a bee hive in one of the trees. Housekeeping is excellent, and the pool is clean and well-kept. Overall, it's a good resort, and with a bit more attention from management, it could be outstanding.",

The outdoor area near the restaurant could be safer, as there s a bee hive in one of the trees. Housekeeping is excellent, and the pool is clean and well-kept.

            "review_text": "Had the most terrible experience of my life at this property. Had to change rooms three times in a 2 night stay, and even after getting upgraded to a suite we still faced problems with hot water supply.\n\nWe checked in smoothly, were allotted a room. We noticed a beeping sound coming in the room, so requested assistance. A person from security came and said it's from the AC, and he will send a technician. After waiting for almost 30 minutes, when no one turned up, we followed up with help desk. Finally a technician turned up and took another 20 minutes to inspect, after which he said the sound will remain and we can request a room change if we want.\n\nWe asked for a room change, they gave us another room which seemed that it hadn't been cleaned properly. Used shampoo bottles were in the bathroom, hair on side tables. We were tired and it was night so we decided to sleep off. Next morning we realized that there was hardly any pressure in shower and no hot water.\n\nWe requested help again, after a long wait and multiple follow-ups, their plumber came to check the shower. He repaired the pressure but there still wasn't any hot water. He said to wait for a while and it will come, meanwhile we requested housekeeping to clean the bathroom because it got dirty after repair. We were told housekeeping will take another 30 minutes to arrive. By this time there was still no hot water and we were running late for our Udaipur tour. We requested another room change.\n\nFront desk told us rooms were being checked out and no clean rooms can be made available before half an hour. By this time we had spent overall 2 hours waiting for resolution. Finally they gave us a downgraded room near the lobby to freshen up, while they waited to prepare a suite to upgrade us. This room also DID NOT HAVE HOT WATER, which was our primary request.\n\nWe were already very late, so left without showering. When we came back in late afternoon they had shifted our luggage to a suite, but even here, we did not get hot water. We asked for two hand towels which were not provided, but they weren't sent for 50 minutes, after which we got one. There was no hand soap also. We were too fed up to argue any more and had to head out again so we just gave up and bought our own towels.\n\nOverall, it was the most harrowing experience, being told that water is fine after telling them that it's cold, being told that cleaning has been done even though there were used bottles in bathrooms. Our whole trip was terrible, our stay as well as our itinerary for visiting the city was completely ruined thanks to Radisson Blu.\n\nI would not recommend anyone to stay at any Radisson property, where guests are treated as a nuisance and made to feel like a burden even after paying a huge amount for their rooms.",

            "review_text": "I recently stayed at the Radisson Blu Udaipur Palace, and honestly, I expected much better service considering how expensive it was. The property itself is beautiful, and the rooms are nice, but the experience was far from smooth.\n\nFirst of all, there was a shocking delay in getting our luggage to the room. We had to call the staff five times, and it still took a frustrating 1 hour and 30 minutes before the luggage was delivered. Because of this delay, we were charged extra by our cab driver since we couldn't leave without our bags. For a hotel that charges such a high price, this kind of negligence is unacceptable.\n\nThe check-in process was equally disappointing. We had to wait around 1.5 hours at the reception before getting our room. This is not the kind of service I would expect from a supposedly premium hotel. To make matters worse, there was a mix-up by the staff. One of the receptionists confused us with another couple and insisted that they couldn't give us a king-sized bed, and instead, we'd have to settle for two joined twin beds. She even tried to convince us that the joined beds were somehow better. After I made it clear that this wasn't what we wanted, she went to check and then returned, saying there had been a misunderstanding, and our room was still getting ready. This whole situation felt very unprofessional and awkward.\n\nBeyond these major issues, there were several minor problems throughout our stay. The room itself was mostly fine, but the kettle was not well-maintained. While the views from the room were pleasant and the property is aesthetically pleasing, the service issues really overshadowed the experience.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed by my stay at Radisson Blu Udaipur Palace. For the amount they charge, I expected much better service. The delays, the confusion at check-in, and the lack of attention to detail made the stay less enjoyable. Unless they address these issues, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a hassle-free, luxury experience.",

            "review_text": "I recently stayed at your property, and unfortunately, my experience fell far below expectations. The check-in process was particularly disappointing. Despite informing the hotel of my expected arrival time, as requested during a phone conversation, there was no preparation made, and the check-in took an unacceptable 1.5 hours. I was not even offered a welcome drink, which added to the poor initial impression.\n\nThe room itself had multiple issues. The flush in the bathroom was malfunctioning, the drawer kept sliding out on its own, and the thermostat seemed to operate on its own schedule, which was quite frustrating.\n\nTo make matters worse, there was no QR code for in-room dining in the room. I called the restaurant three times but received no assistance. It wasn't until later in the evening, after personally going to the reception, that I was finally provided with the QR code.\n\nOverall, the service did not meet the standard I would expect from a 5-star hotel. After checking other Google reviews, I found that I wasn't the only one experiencing such poor service, which was somewhat of a relief but also troubling. It appears that these issues have been ongoing and not addressed.\n\nI hope management starts taking negative feedback seriously. Guests book properties like Radisson expecting top-notch service and a comfortable stay. With the current level of service, however, it's likely to damage the hotel's reputation. I urge you to address these concerns to prevent further decline.",

The breakfast service was also slow but not bad.\nThe biggest  issue was them not honoring the VIP status.

The airport pick-up went smoothly, but unfortunately, our stay at the hotel began with a rather rough check-in experience in the evening. One of our rooms had a very unpleasant smell and needed to be changed, a process that took nearly 45 minutes. During this time, we were asked to wait in the lobby, and the communication with the staff was challenging due to limited English proficiency, which is quite inadequate for a 5-star hotel.\n\nThe rooms themselves were underwhelming and not well-cleaned. In one room, the shower wasn't functioning, so we were forced to use the bathtub to shower, which was quite inconvenient. During the day, there was significant noise within the hotel, and one of the rooms had an annoying beeping sound that reoccurred. At night, we faced further issues: above one of our rooms, drilling and furniture moving noises could be heard periodically, making it difficult to sleep. In the other room, the bass and music from a wedding celebration held at the hotel were audible until midnight. With over 350 guests at this event, it felt as though the wedding was prioritized, and other guests were somewhat neglected. Additionally, we had to reactivate the key card for the initial room, as it stopped working.\n\nA true highlight, however, was the service in the Aangan Terrace Bar and Aravli Lake View Restaurant & Bar, where the staff was exceptionally attentive, courteous, and friendly. We also enjoyed the quality of the food, especially the well-organized breakfast buffet with freshly prepared egg dishes and Indian specialties.\n\nThe location of the hotel is excellent--central and ideal for accessing Udaipur's main attractions. However, the hotel's overall facilities show considerable signs of aging. The room interiors were acceptable but lacked appeal. The fitness area was well-equipped, and the pool area was beautifully arranged, although we didn't end up using it.\n\nOverall, our impression of the hotel was disappointing. Upon check-in, we were given no information about the hotel or its facilities, and during check-out, no one inquired about our experience, giving the impression that guest satisfaction wasn't a priority. In summary, the Radisson Blu Palace Resort & Spa in Udaipur fell far short of the expectations for a 5-star property. If anything, this review earns a maximum of 2 stars, primarily due to the excellent service in the dining areas. Regrettably, we cannot recommend this hotel if there are any events on going.",

            "review_text": "Had the most terrible experience of my life at this property. Had to change rooms three times in a 2 night stay, and even after getting upgraded to a suite we still faced problems with hot water supply. We checked in smoothly, were allotted a room. We noticed a beeping sound coming in the room, so requested assistance. A person from security came and said its from the AC, and he will send a technician. After waiting for almost 30 minutes, when no one turned up, we followed up with help desk. Finally a technician turned up and took another 20 minutes to inspect, after which he said the sound will remain and we can request a room change if we want. We asked for a room change, they gave us another room which seemed that it hadnt been cleaned properly. Used shampoo bottles were in the bathroom, hair on side tables. We were tired and it was night so we decided to sleep off. Next morning we realized that there was hardly any pressure in shower and no hot water. We requested help again, after a long wait and multiple follow-ups, their plumber came to check the shower. He repaired the pressure but there still wasnt any hot water. He said to wait for a while and it will come, meanwhile we requested housekeeping to clean the bathroom because it got dirty after repair. We were told housekeeping will take another 30 minutes to arrive. By this time there was still no hot water and we were running late for our Udaipur tour. We requested another room change. Front desk told us rooms were being checked out and no clean rooms can be made available before half an hour. By this time we had spent overall 2 hours waiting for resolution. Finally they gave us a downgraded room near the lobby to freshen up, while they waited to prepare a suite to upgrade us. This room also DID NOT HAVE HOT WATER, which was our primary request. We were already very late, so left without showering. When we came back in late afternoon they had shifted our luggage to a suite, but even here, we did not get hot water. We asked for two hand towels which were not provided, but they werent sent for 50 minutes, after which we got one. There was no hand soap also. We were too fed up to argue any more and had to head out again so we just gave up and bought our own towels. Overall, it was the most harrowing experience, being told that water is fine after telling them that its cold, being told that cleaning has been done even though there were used bottles in bathrooms. Our whole trip was terrible, our stay as well as our itinerary for visiting the city was completely ruined thanks to Radisson Blu. I would not recommend anyone to stay at any Radisson property, where guests are treated as a nuisance and made to feel like a burden even after paying a huge amount for their rooms.",

            "review_text": "I recently stayed at the Radisson Blu Udaipur Palace, and honestly, I expected much better service considering how expensive it was. The property itself is beautiful, and the rooms are nice, but the experience was far from smooth. First of all, there was a shocking delay in getting our luggage to the room. We had to call the staff five times, and it still took a frustrating 1 hour and 30 minutes before the luggage was delivered. Because of this delay, we were charged extra by our cab driver since we couldn t leave without our bags. For a hotel that charges such a high price, this kind of negligence is unacceptable. The check-in process was equally disappointing. We had to wait around 1.5 hours at the reception before getting our room. This is not the kind of service I would expect from a supposedly premium hotel. To make matters worse, there was a mix-up by the staff. One of the receptionists confused us with another couple and insisted that they couldn t give us a king-sized bed, and instead, we d have to settle for two joined twin beds. She even tried to convince us that the joined beds were somehow better. After I made it clear that this wasn t what we wanted, she went to check and then returned, saying there had been a misunderstanding, and our room was still getting ready. This whole situation felt very unprofessional and awkward. Beyond these major issues, there were several minor problems throughout our stay. The room itself was mostly fine, but the kettle was not well-maintained. While the views from the room were pleasant and the property is aesthetically pleasing, the service issues really overshadowed the experience. Overall, I was disappointed by my stay at Radisson Blu Udaipur Palace. For the amount they charge, I expected much better service. The delays, the confusion at check-in, and the lack of attention to detail made the stay less enjoyable. Unless they address these issues, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone looking for a hassle-free, luxury experience.",

I am sorry, the phone was also not working so I called them from another room and they picked up the call on third time.",

The sheets were stained, the bathroom was old and dirty, the pillows and mattresses also had many stains on it, I don't know how this place is considered 3 star. The AC was freezing cold, the temperature could not be changed and the wind was very intense. The toilet was broken and began to smell halfway through our two night stay. This place looks as if it needs to be demolished or given to new owners. This place is a catfish to say the least, the photos depict a decent hotel to stay at but this was a below average stay at the least, I would definitely rather stay in a hostel. Also forgot to mention before, we may have found a rat in our room in the middle of the night and extremely unpleasant experience. My advice to anyone staying in Udaipur is book your hotel well in advance otherwise these types of places will be the only ones left! The bare minimum is basic hygiene even if the room is not comfortable!",

They were far from the standard you would expect for the price charged. The amenities felt outdated, and the cleanliness was questionable. For a property in this price range, I expected much better. It is definitely not a good value for money, and I was left feeling dissatisfied with the overall quality of the accommodation.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to relax and enjoy your stay, I would strongly advise against choosing this property.

            "review_text": "The experience at this hotel was truly disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone expecting basic hospitality. We checked in around 5:30 PM, and when a friend arrived at 6:45 PM, the staff rudely informed us that guests were not allowed due to some hotel policy. Instead of communicating politely, they practically told us we could leave if we didn't like it. When we tried to escalate the issue to the manager, his response was even worse. He said we should have notified them beforehand and provided a \"valid\" reason for the guest's visit, as if we were in a hostel or an office rather than a so-called 4-star hotel.\n\nOnce inside the room, the problems continued. There was no hot water available, and the staff never bothered to inform us about it. I had to call them twice after using the bathroom, only to be told that hot water would take another 15 minutes to come. Every time we wanted to use hot water, we had to wait at least 15 minutes, which is completely unacceptable.\n\nOn top of that, the drinking water provided was questionable at best. There was no sealed bottled water, just a random glass bottle filled with water that clearly lacked any proper quality control. The room itself was subpar--far from what you'd expect from a 4-star property. The windows were filthy with dust, and the entire room felt like a hastily renovated home rather than a professionally maintained hotel room.\n\nThe bathroom lacked basic amenities. There was no hair dryer, and shockingly, no back mirror either--features that should be standard in any decent hotel. Overall, it felt more like a shabby guesthouse than a supposed luxury hotel.

From the moment I arrived, the staff at check-in were noticeably rude and lacked the basic hospitality etiquette you would expect at any decent hotel. Instead of being welcomed, I felt as though I was being treated like a guest at a hostel, with no warmth or professionalism in their interactions. The rooms were also a letdown. They were far from the standard you would expect for the price charged. The amenities felt outdated, and the cleanliness was questionable. For a property in this price range, I expected much better. It is definitely not a good value for money, and I was left feeling dissatisfied with the overall quality of the accommodation. If you re looking for a place to relax and enjoy your stay, I would strongly advise against choosing this property. The lack of hospitality, poor service, and subpar room quality made for an unpleasant experience. There s a lot of room for improvement in both staff training and the upkeep of the facilities.",

Half of the things in the menu aren't available, and the ones that are are surely going to be so disappointing, you'd wish you hadn't ordered them.\n\nFood here is also so overpriced, their marketing team gave us some coupons with a 50% discount, so the bill was 2000 instead of 4000, but the food is so bad that you'd definitely regret paying even 500 for it.\n\nTheir marketing team also falsely advertised the hotel coupon scheme about outside liquor, and the hotel staff is so uneducated and unintelligent, that they don't even understand that their job is to provide hospitality, and not fight with the customers about a misunderstanding their own affiliates have created.\n\nTheir behavior is probably worse than the location of this hotel, which is so difficult to find. I had to give my friend a custom located pin on Google maps, because the logical entry here is blocked by some garage which make make anyone you invite confused.\n\nWhen you visit the hotel or restaurant, you'll probably find almost no guests present there, which is a clear indication of how bad the facilities are.\n\nWe haven't tried booking a room yet, but if the other reviews about used toiletries are correct, I am sure that they'd probably be even worse than the restaurant services we were unfortunate to experience.",

            "review_text": "I recently stayed at Hotel Paras Mahal with my family (my wife and our 2-year-old son), and from start to finish, it was a wonderful experience. The property is exceptionally kid-friendly, and my baby enjoyed the stay immensely. The staff was very polite and helpful throughout our visit. Although we were initially allocated the wrong room, the staff quickly recognized the mistake and corrected it within 5 minutes, upgrading us to the suite we had booked. The suite was luxurious, featuring a jacuzzi with 24-hour hot and cold water--a real treat! The hotel also has a very clean swimming pool where our son spent most of his time, enjoying every moment. The rooms are spacious and well-ventilated, and the room service is excellent--our requests were attended to within a minute. The check-in and check-out processes were hassle-free and quick, adding to the overall smooth experience. The property also offers a spacious parking area and a small garden where we enjoyed some quality time. The hotel's location is convenient, with easy access to nearby tourist spots. We often returned to the hotel for a break before heading out to explore more of Udaipur. Overall, my family, especially my 2-year-old, had a great time at Hotel Paras Mahal. I highly recommend this place to anyone traveling with family. It was truly a pleasant experience, and we would love to return.",

A millipede entered the bathroom by the exhaust duct since the exhaust wasnt working neither is was sealed. The room into which we checked in was a non smoking room still a strong smell of alcohol and ciggerate was coming from.it, the staff tried to apply the air fresheners but it didnt work. Kindly take it as a feedback, and work positively on it, the hotel has a tremendous scope due to.its location on the entrance of the city. The food was good too the options were a bit less, sambhar was on the sweeter side, so south indian menu can be improved. Rooms: Slightly old rooms, there is a scope of improvement. Noteworthy details: On the entrance of the city.",

We booked a room with a balcony, thinking it was private, but were never informed that the balcony was shared with another room. Imagine our shock when, while using the balcony, we suddenly saw someone opening the door from the other side. This was terrifying and completely unacceptable, making us feel unsafe and intruded upon in what was supposed to be a private space. When we informed the hotel management, they simply shrugged it off, saying they \"forgot to mention it.\"\n\nThis is beyond negligence. Picture being in your own room with the balcony door open, unaware that anyone from the adjoining room could enter. This lack of privacy and security is horrifying and unacceptable. The staff's indifference to our concerns only made matters worse. If you value your safety and peace of mind, do NOT stay here.",

We booked a room with a balcony, thinking it was private, but were never informed that the balcony was shared with another room. Imagine our shock when, while using the balcony, we suddenly saw someone opening the door from the other side. This was terrifying and completely unacceptable, making us feel unsafe and intruded upon in what was supposed to be a private space. When we informed the hotel management, they simply shrugged it off, saying they forgot to mention it. This is beyond negligence. Picture being in your own room with the balcony door open, unaware that anyone from the adjoining room could enter. This lack of privacy and security is horrifying and unacceptable. The staff s indifference to our concerns only made matters worse. If you value your safety and peace of mind, do NOT stay here.",

Mr. Pratik who belongs from siliguri provided the best golf cart ride to drop us for the boat ride. Mr. Sourav from Kolkata, and form housekeeping department worked hard to make sure our rooms were supercleaned. Mr V singh from the restaurant who helped us with the baby food. Sorry to miss out on the names of all others but everyone did a commendable job.||||Lastly i would just like you to keep up the good work and request the management to provide a safe and healthy work culture for its staff.",
